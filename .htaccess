# Various rewrite rules.
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine on
    # To force http:// to https://
    #RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
    #RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]

    # If your site can be accessed both with and without the 'www.' prefix, you
    # can use one of the following settings to redirect users to your preferred
    # URL, either WITH or WITHOUT the 'www.' prefix. Choose ONLY one option:
    #
    # To redirect all users to access the site WITH the 'www.' prefix,
    # (http://example.com/... will be redirected to http://www.example.com/...)
    # adapt and uncomment the following:
    # RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^example\.com$ [NC]
    # RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.example.com/$1 [L,R=301]
    #
    # To redirect all users to access the site WITHOUT the 'www.' prefix,
    # (http://www.example.com/... will be redirected to http://example.com/...)
    # uncomment and adapt the following:
    # RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.example\.com$ [NC]
    # RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://example.com/$1 [L,R=301]

    # Modify the RewriteBase if you are using Application in a subdirectory or in a
    # VirtualDocumentRoot and the rewrite rules are not working properly.
    # For example if your site is at http://example.com/application uncomment and
    # modify the following line:
    RewriteBase /swassertive/app/

    # If your site is running in a VirtualDocumentRoot at http://example.com/,
    # uncomment the following line:
    # RewriteBase /

    # Rewrite URLs of the form 'x' to the form 'index.php?q=x'.
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-l
    # RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !=/favicon.ico
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.html?q=$1 [L,QSA]
